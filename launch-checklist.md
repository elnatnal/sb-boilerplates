# Sinatra boilerplate: https://github.com/sinefunc/sinatra-minify

# Idea for Checklist program
- Configurable by PM on basis of spec doc
e.g. browsers to test, devices to test
- Capable of connecting with git
e.g. git commit -m 'optimized images [check 12]'
- Prioritization
- Mandatory checklist for every project
e.g. code optimization, speed test, image optimization, etc.

- Could work into ultimate PM tool, as part of "Prelaunch" timeline. For example, if each part of the process were separated by project moments. list example below:
----- Engagement One
---------- Discovery
---------- Architecture/Wireframing/Prototyping
---------- Approved.
------ Engagement Two
---------- Design
------------- Deliverable
------------- Deliverable

---------- Front End Development

---------- Back End Development
