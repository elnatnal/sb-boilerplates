# Smashing Boxes Design/FEDev process
## Transparency

- Discovery
- Spec doc finalized
(when spec doc gets "finalized", back end developers, if able, can start development process)
- Wireframe/Prototype
* out-of-the-box grid systems, probably flat or sinatra templates, quick, clickable, not browser compliant, etc.
* Code'n'test
* Show to client, gleam feedback
(when wireframes, etc are worked through, hand off to back end devs as visuals for development screens/actions/or moments in the application. earlier is better. They can start sending code to front end devs when able to for views to be created)

_After wireframes/prototypes are approved, the process branches into two stages_
- Design
* Design in browser, photoshop, both, illustrator, whatever tool is most appropriate for budget, etc.
* Keep client in loop and a part of process. Think more coworker or partner in the project, not as the "client"
* show on different deliverables, perhaps. i.e. each page? each section? each component? Probably not component, but you get my drift. It will be different for each project.
* Feedback loop during design. Complex interactions take to dev's and talk about possibilities.
- FEDevelopment
* Take wireframes and start building in appropriate CMS (usually almost always is one there)
* Clean code, start building all components. As design process and hands off grids, fonts, etc. implement. Communication and collaboration between dev/design is crucial.
* Comment as you code.
