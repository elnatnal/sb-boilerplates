		<h4>Apps for small businesses</h4>
		<p>Most businesses can't afford a custom application. They miss out on customers that spend 3.5 hours a day on mobile devices. That's where we come in. Inkless delivers an out-of-the-box application of rich features so that businesses don't have to pay the usual tens of thousands of dollars. Any business can afford an app with Inkless.
